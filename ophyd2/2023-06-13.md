_switched from Dropbox Paper to HackMD_

- Discussion on DLS/NSLS-II visit (Joe Handford)
- Discussion of bluesky/bundlers.py
    - To add a collect_pages, or modify collect
        - Decision: Have describe_collect, collect, and collect_pages.
        - Change describe collect so it doesn’t have stream name? (Decision: Yes.)
        - Should we deprecate stream along with the bulk collect (now that we’re going with the paging model)?https://github.com/bluesky/bluesky/blob/e38b2dab394300fff1cc02fbc5bd2fba23cbfdc1/bluesky/bundlers.py#LL713C16-L713C16
        - Tomo recipe: https://bcda-aps.github.io/bluesky_training/howto/_images_darks_flats.html
        - Decision: add name to collect message for stream name
        - Decision: add collect to declare_stream message to work out whether to call describe or describe_collect
- For future reference: order the event-model and bluesky bundler PRs need to be merged
